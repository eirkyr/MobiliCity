                <p>The visualisation entitled "2022 Daily Traffic Data Summary for Greece" provides a comprehensive look at traffic measurement data throughout the year. It is displayed as a two-axis chart and features two distinct data sets: the total daily traffic counts depicted by the green line and the day-to-day percentage change (DOD) depicted by the blue line. The primary y-axis on the left quantifies total traffic, ranging from approximately 344,000 to 1,002,126 counts, while the secondary y-axis on the right displays DOD changes, ranging from -80.15% to over 526.03%.</p>
                <p>The results from the total daily traffic counts show significant fluctuations throughout the year. These fluctuations can be attributed to several factors, such as weekday versus weekend traffic, holidays, and seasonal variations that affect travel behavior. Higher peaks indicate days with extremely high traffic, which could coincide with special events or peak tourist periods, which is particularly important in a country such as Greece, which is known for its seasonal tourism.</p>
                <p>The DOD graph, illustrated by the blue line, provides information on the relative change in traffic from one day to the next. This metric is vital to understanding daily variations and could help identify specific events or anomalies that cause significant increases or decreases in traffic flow. For example, sharp spikes or drops indicate public strikes, extreme weather and other disturbances that affect normal traffic patterns. Overall, this visualization serves as a valuable tool for traffic analysts and urban planners to monitor, analyze, and predict traffic behavior and plan accordingly for future infrastructure needs or policy adjustments in the country.</p>

            <div class="content" style="padding-left:20%; padding-right:20%;">
                <p>The charts illustrate trends in railway passenger transport and freight transport volume in Greece from 1995 to 2021. The first chart shows that there was a relative decline in the use of railway passenger transport after 2007, with a sharp decrease around 2020 likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite some fluctuations, the general trend indicates reduced reliance on rail travel in recent years.</p>    
                <p>The second chart shows that railway freight transport experienced growth up until 2008, followed by a decline, but it has been steadily increasing since 2013. This indicates that while freight transport by rail has recovered and grown, passenger transport has not seen a similar resurgence.</p>     
                <p>These trends suggest a need to encourage more people to use public transport, such as railways, instead of private vehicles. Increasing public transport usage can help address environmental concerns, reduce traffic congestion, and offer economic and social benefits. The decline in railway passenger transport highlights an area for improvement, and efforts should be made to revert to higher usage levels seen in the past.</p>

        <div class="title" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 400px;">Stock of Vehicles by Country from 2018 – 2022</div>
        <div class="subsections" style="text-align: center;">
            
            <div class="content" style="padding-left:20%; padding-right:20%;">            
                <p>This visualization displays the stock of vehicles by country across Europe and adjacent regions from 2018 to 2022. The map uses a color-coded system, with lighter colors indicating fewer vehicles and darker colors indicating higher vehicle densities, to highlight regional differences in vehicle ownership. It includes interactive features, such as year selection and a "Show history" option, allowing users to track changes in vehicle stock over time and analyze trends related to economic growth or policy impacts. <br></p>
                <p>The vehicle distribution on the visualization, indicated by darker shades, aligns with higher urbanization and industrialization, suggesting more vehicles in countries like Germany, Italy, and France. Between 2018 and 2022, vehicle stocks in these nations rose due to economic recovery, low-interest rates that made car financing more accessible, and increased demand for personal vehicles amid public transit concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The automotive industry boosted this growth by offering incentives and benefiting from policies that encouraged the purchase of newer, eco-friendlier vehicles. These elements together drove the noticeable increase in vehicle registrations across these major economies.</p>
                <p>For Greece, the visualization captures a notable trend in vehicle ownership over the five-year period. Starting with a vehicle stock of 6,646,807 in 2018, there was a slight increase to 6,786,186 in 2019. However, from 2020 onwards, a sharp decline is observed, with counts falling to 5,543,819 in 2020, 5,657,830 in 2021, and 5,777,241 in 2022. Greece’s vehicle stock might be less than the major economies of Europe but comparable or higher than some of its Balkan neighbors or other similarly sized countries. The significant decrease in Greece's vehicle stock from 2020 onwards can be largely attributed to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought economic disruptions, strict lockdowns, and shifts in transportation preferences. Reduced household incomes and consumer confidence deterred vehicle purchases, while mobility restrictions decreased the immediate need for personal and commercial vehicles. Additionally, global supply chain challenges, especially in the automotive sector, hindered vehicle production and availability. These factors, coupled with government policies promoting greener transportation alternatives, collectively contributed to the observed decline in vehicle numbers during this period.</p>

                <p>The chart illustrates the overall trend in the number of private vehicles in Greece from 1985 to 2023, encompassing passenger cars, motorcycles, buses, and trucks. Over this period, there has been a marked increase in the total number of private vehicles. This growth is most pronounced in passenger cars, which have surged significantly, but other categories like motorcycles and trucks have also shown steady increases.</p>
                <p>The upward trajectory in private vehicle ownership highlights a growing reliance on personal transportation in Greece. This trend suggests an increasing preference for the convenience and flexibility of private vehicles over public transportation options. The rising number of vehicles on the road has potential implications for traffic congestion, environmental pollution, and urban infrastructure.</p>
                <p>As private vehicle numbers continue to grow, there is a clear need for strategies to manage the associated challenges, such as enhancing public transport systems, promoting sustainable transportation alternatives, and improving urban planning to accommodate the higher vehicle density. Encouraging the use of public transport could help mitigate some of these issues, reducing congestion and emissions while providing efficient mobility solutions for the population.</p>
